## Devnotes for runner

1. Title screen
2. Actual gameplay
3. End screen

#### Title screen

#### Actual gameplay
timer
speed
distance

Animated bg features:
Easy colorize each level
Smooth change in place

#### End screen


#### Paralax bg:
its better and simpler not to create multiple bitmaps, but built

resolved
// TODO: fix mixed animated bg strip. mb we need to double length (easy way)
Benefits of using double length strip is that we can replace parts dynamicaly making level change very smooth

#### Runner controls:
Left TAP - slow down a bit

#### Levels
Requirements for MVP:
One big level but with dynamic bg sprites and colors
Data stored in level:
SPRITES: 
NO need to describe layout transitions: it can be autogenerated by taking next stage layout

screen_w: 320
bg_tile_w: 32

means 10 tiles to cover
means +10 exact copies at end

DATA needed:
entity + pallete = layout + pallete

###### Levels switch sprites
we need to switch second 10 then after screen switch first 10

#### QUICK PLAN:
I need the way to switch layers and pallete on demand
On demand means - some conditions
Instead of using time, we should use DISTANCE and SPEED
I need the way to adjust player speed, BUT:
player speed is a speed of level

OR. maybe just use ECS TO MAKE calcs with dynamic phys objects
but. use plain procedural (for now) for everything else
and name that module runnerGame:
3 states:
    start screen
    actual gameplay
    end screen
ACTUALLY:
i dont need 3 screens.
I can just disable player controlls for title and end
    and make big long house
    then just render nice Title, or etc


on transition i just reorder to next level
                     recolor to next level


SO i need 3 helpers:
    reorder bg layout
    recolor bg pallete
    regenerate blocks
and 2 more:
    transition for layout
    interpolate pallete

## Another idea for BG
I make prev idea work.. partialy. The problem that .reorder makes completely new bitmap
and its hard to apply colors. I did a lot of shitcode, but now I know what to do:
Double sized row as always, but if transition is in progress:
having new order - use .copyTile to update tiles on shift < 0 - twidth
in addition we will apply pallete on the whole row by steps.
So lets to this.

## Refactoring notes
#### 2 EntityManagers:
    1. for game objects
    2. for backgrounds
    Note: World appears in both
          Stage is a component as well
Due to deadline: refactor later

#### Idea for name: MurkitRunner
## MVP plans:
такий план:
[+] плавний перехід палітри (середня тяжкість)
[ ] генерація домів по яким треба буде стрибати (легко)
[ ] намалювати печиво та кофійок (легко та приємно)
[+] управління з миші/тачпаду (легко, накостиляю швидко)
[ ] ще 2 рівні: початковий - де просто котик біжить(некерований) і видно тайтл гри + підказки для КЕРУВАННЯ
[ ] і кінцевий де теж котик просто біжить(некерований) і якась статистика + час



House/platform generation:
to make it easy, lets just generate some pattern and do a favorite algorithm - random;
BUT: random placement should possible to reach via jump
So, this means we need to calculate max jump, which means fix controls


#### Idea for future: endless runner with stages generation
