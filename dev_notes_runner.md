## Devnotes for runner

1. Title screen
2. Actual gameplay
3. End screen

#### Title screen

#### Actual gameplay
timer
speed
distance

Animated bg features:
Easy colorize each level
Smooth change in place

#### End screen


#### Paralax bg:
its better and simpler not to create multiple bitmaps, but built

resolved
// TODO: fix mixed animated bg strip. mb we need to double length (easy way)
Benefits of using double length strip is that we can replace parts dynamicaly making level change very smooth

#### Runner controls:
Left TAP - slow down a bit

#### Levels
Requirements for MVP:
One big level but with dynamic bg sprites and colors
Data stored in level:
SPRITES: 
NO need to describe layout transitions: it can be autogenerated by taking next stage layout

screen_w: 320
bg_tile_w: 32

means 10 tiles to cover
means +10 exact copies at end


###### Levels switch sprites
we need to switch second 10 then after screen switch first 10










## Refactoring notes
#### 2 EntityManagers:
    1. for game objects
    2. for backgrounds
    Note: World appears in both
          Stage is a component as well
Due to deadline: refactor later
